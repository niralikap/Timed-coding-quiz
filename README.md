# challenge-jul-12 (Timed-coding-quiz)

##Description

In this challenge, I have developed a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will do the following:

- I have created a start page with the quiz rules. 

- On the click of the 'Start Quiz' button, the timer starts and shows different questions with multiple choices. Once the answer is selected, the user is provided with the status of the answer if it is the "Correct" or the "Wrong" answer and moves to the next question. 

- It hides the previous question form and only shows the next question form. The questions along with the answer and it's subsequent options were given in an array.

- When the user's answer is incorrect, the timer automatically deducts 10 seconds. This affects the total score.

- Once the quiz is done, the user is shown the total score of the quiz and asked to provide initials on another page. There is a check on empty value on the initials text box. It does not move forward, unless the user provides the initials.

- Once the user enters the initials and clicks on the "Submit" button, the user is taken to the "Highscores" page.

- The "Highscores" page shows the total number of times the user attempted the quiz, along with the initials and the score obtained each time.

- On the click of the 'Clear Highscores' button, the user history of the number of attempts, initials, and the score is cleared.

- On the click of "Go Back" button, the user is taken to the main (instructions) page. The time gets refreshed to zero.
